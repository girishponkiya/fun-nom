This repository makes available the [source code](code) of the neural
classification models used in 
[Fares et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06748) and the
noun–noun compounds [dataset](dataset) created 
by [Fares (2016)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-3011).


# Dataset

The noun–noun compounds [dataset](dataset) created by Fares (2016) consists of
compounds annotated with two different taxonomies of relations; that is, for each
noun–noun compound there are two distinct relations, drawing on different
linguistic schools. The dataset was derived from existing linguistic resources,
such as NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) and the Prague Czech-English Dependency
Treebank 2.0 (PCEDT; Hajič et al., 2012).
